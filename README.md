How to Install
=======
For now there will be no installer and it will be a simple portable program. 

Step 1 -
- Make a folder called 'praw-rt' on the local drive 
- Make sure that the path to the folder is 'C:\praw-rt'

Step 2 -
- Put your Python scripts (The PRAW-Reddit-Ticker python files) into that folder
- Rename the .py files to '1' or '2' or '3' (it will open all files named 1, 2, and 3 at the same time)
